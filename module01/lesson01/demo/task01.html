    <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum
        <sup><small style="color: darkslateblue">[1]</small></sup>) is a machine that
        transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles,
        motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses),
        railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats),
        amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft),
        aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup><small style="color: darkslateblue">[2]</small></sup>
    </p>

    <p style="opacity: 0.5;">Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to
        apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
        wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard,
        also internationally used in legislation, for road
        vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup><small style="color: darkslateblue">[3]</small></sup>
