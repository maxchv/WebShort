    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> (<b><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></b>) is the standard
        markup
        language for creating web pages and web
        applications.</p>

    <p>Web browsers receive <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        documents from a web server or from
        local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia
        web
        pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance
        of
        the
        document.</p>

    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive
        forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements
        are
        delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
        Tags such as &lt;img /> and &lt;input /> directly introduce content
        into
        the
        page. Other tags such as &lt;p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags
        as
        sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>

    HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),
    character-based
    data types, character references and entity references.
    HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1> and
    &lt;/h1>,
    although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is
    the
    start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

    Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.

    The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
    <pre style="color:brown"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>

&lt;head>
    &lt;title>This is a title&lt;/title>
&lt;/head>

&lt;body>
    &lt;p>Hello world!&lt;/p>
&lt;/body>

&lt;/html>
</code></pre>
